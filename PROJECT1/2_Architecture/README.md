## Applications
The point of the project is to use a wireless key to control the system.
Machine security, as well as when users want to secure their cars, will be aided by wireless keys.
We can make use of vehicle parking spaces.
RKEs are also used to control entry to premises and specific areas of buildings, such as garages.
