# REQUIREMENTS:    
## Introduction:

This is a project based on REMOTE KEYLESS ENTRY which helps to unlock 
and lock the car doors with other functions also like turning Off/On Alarm and
nearby approach. Remote keyless entry system contain a short-range radio transmitter,
and must be within a certain range, usually 5-20 meters, of the car to work.
When a button is pushed, it sends a coded signal by radio waves to a receiver 
unit in the car, which will do the preferred functions.

## INPUT FUNCTIONS:
* In SINGLE click, the car will be loacked
* In DOUBLE clicks, the car will be unlocked
* In TRIPLE clicks, On/OFF of the alarm system of the car
* In QUADRUPLE clicks, Theft security system activated

## STATE OF ART:
* Buttons and LED's are installed in REmote keyless entry system
* Lock/Unlock, Alarm and Approach light Activation/Deactivation are provided
* Transmitter is provide to transmit the signal
* Receiver provided to receive the signal
